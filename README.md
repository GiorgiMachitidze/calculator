  This project is about to help schoolchildren studying geometry figures better. In this project we create different pages for different gometry figures and on this pages
when user enters corresponding values of edges or height program calculates areas and perimeters of figures. There is also mainpage where
user chooses which geometry figure is interesting for him/her to calculate area,perimeter, after user push on "choose" pushbutton page of corresponding figure
appear and user after enters needed values program calculates desire results.
